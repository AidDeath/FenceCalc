# FenceCalc
Adaptive calc for building fence from wooden pieces. Calculates sizes and amount of wood.

Little help tool for calculating of needed wooden pieces of wood and values of free space among them, while building fence.
There is no another usage, but adjustment sizes and finding out how many wood you need to buy.
Was helpful for me personally =)
